# ðŸŽµ Spotify Playlist Export Tool

We often want to save the current shuffled playlist but cannot do that as there's no in-built feature in Spotify.  
This project is built to solve that problem by allowing you to capture your current shuffle queue and save it as a new playlist using Python and the Spotify API.

A Python-based tool to export your **current "Now Playing" queue** or any Spotify playlist into a local text file.  
Built using the **Spotipy** library and Spotify Web API.
